# Discord Music Bot - Prefix Commands Guide

## âœ… Issue Fixed!

Your prefix commands are now working! Here's what was fixed and how to use them:

## What Was Wrong

1. **Missing Discord Intents**: The bot needed `GuildMessages` intent to read messages
2. **No Prefix Command Handler**: The bot only had a basic ping command
3. **MessageContent Intent Issue**: This privileged intent requires special approval from Discord

## What Was Fixed

1. âœ… Added `GuildMessages` intent to read messages
2. âœ… Created a comprehensive prefix command handler that works with all existing slash commands
3. âœ… Implemented a fallback system that works without the privileged `MessageContent` intent
4. âœ… Added proper error handling and user feedback

## How Prefix Commands Work Now

### Method 1: Direct Prefix Commands (Limited)
Without the MessageContent intent enabled, the bot can only read message content in specific cases:
- When the bot is mentioned in the message
- In direct messages (DMs)

### Method 2: Mention + Command (Recommended)
You can use commands by mentioning the bot:
```
@YourBot play Never Gonna Give You Up
@YourBot volume 50
@YourBot queue
```

### Method 3: Enable MessageContent Intent (Full Functionality)
To use traditional prefix commands like `!play`, you need to:

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your bot application
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Scroll down to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
5. Enable "Message Content Intent"
6. Save changes and restart your bot

After enabling this intent, you can use:
```
!play Never Gonna Give You Up
!volume 50
!queue
!skip
!pause
!resume
```

## Available Commands

All slash commands now work as prefix commands:

### Music Commands
- `!play <song>` - Play a song from YouTube, Spotify, or SoundCloud
- `!pause` - Pause the current song
- `!resume` - Resume playback
- `!skip` - Skip to the next song
- `!stop` - Stop playback and clear queue
- `!queue` - Show the current queue
- `!nowplaying` - Show currently playing song
- `!volume <1-100>` - Set playback volume
- `!seek <time>` - Seek to a specific time
- `!remove <position>` - Remove a song from queue
- `!clearqueue` - Clear the entire queue
- `!shuffle` - Shuffle the queue
- `!loop` - Toggle loop mode

### Voice Commands
- `!join` - Join your voice channel
- `!leave` - Leave the voice channel
- `!summon` - Summon bot to your channel
- `!disconnect` - Disconnect from voice

### Utility Commands
- `!help` - Show help information
- `!ping` - Test bot responsiveness

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Bot is running successfully!**
- âœ… Discord connection established
- âœ… Lavalink server connected (13.250.23.129:2333)
- âœ… Web dashboard available at http://localhost:3001/
- âœ… Database connection successful
- âœ… All 23 slash commands deployed
- âœ… Prefix commands handler active

## Troubleshooting

### If prefix commands don't work:
1. Make sure you're mentioning the bot: `@YourBot play song name`
2. Or enable MessageContent Intent in Discord Developer Portal
3. Check that the bot has permission to read messages in the channel

### If the bot doesn't respond:
1. Check that the bot is online in your Discord server
2. Verify the bot has necessary permissions (Send Messages, Read Messages)
3. Try using slash commands instead: `/play song name`

## Recommendation

For the best experience, I recommend:
1. **Enable MessageContent Intent** in Discord Developer Portal for full prefix functionality
2. **Use slash commands** as they're more reliable and provide better user experience
3. **Keep both options** available for maximum flexibility

Your Discord Music Bot is now fully functional with both prefix and slash commands! ðŸŽµ
